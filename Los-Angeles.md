Don't go if you don't drive. Visiting LA without a car would be just a frustrating experience.

## Museums

* Getty (plan at least a few hours)
* The Broad

## Shopping
* Arcana: Books on the Arts

## Food

* Traktir Restaurant for Eastern Europenian Food
* Asanebo (Japanese, Michelin guide)
* Millie's Cafe
* Langer's Delicatessen

## Coffee

* Stereoscope Coffee
* Dinosaur Coffee

## Beautiful spots

LA is surronded by hills. My favourite activity was to drive around and find a nice spot to watch a sunset.

* Angels Point
* Griffith Observatory

## Where to stay

* Echo park / Silver lake - instead of Airbnb, try to find a weekly rental on Craigslist.
