# Travel

Budapest is really close to Vienna which is one of my favourite cities.
If you have an extra day, you can take a bus or train there. It's only 2.5 hours from Budapest.

For cheapest option, take orange lines bus (15 eur). For more comfortable option with wifi onboard, take the train (20-30 eur).
