Start by reading patio11's [Travel recommendations for Japan](https://www.kalzumeus.com/japan-recommendations/). Some of it is dated but here are few things that resonated to me:

> 90% of you will want to go to Kyoto or Osaka. I’d tell you to pick Kyoto; Osaka has its charms, and the Osakans will regale you with them endlessly, but Osaka’s charms are like Tokyo’s and Kyoto’s are far less so.

> You should have most of your meals at places which you don’t know the name of and which, ideally, see relatively few foreign guests. Almost every train station in Japanese cities has an almost arbitrary depth of restaurants around it. The ones closest to the station are not your best options, but go out any station gate and walk 2-3 blocks (a few hundred meters) and then just walk in anywhere.

> If you want ramen, eat ramen sitting next to a salaryman going home from work. If you want sushi, eat at a restaurant a middle-class family would make a special Saturday night out of or a little hole in the wall, not at one whose name appears in the New York Times frequently.

The **coffee scene** is really weird. You'll find either $20 speciality coffee or Starbucks-style chains. There's very little in between. If you're a fan of high-end pour-over coffee, Tokyo is your place.

## Areas to stay

* Nakameguro (if focusing on shopping)

  * Visiting Starbucks Reserve is a must ("Would I tell someone who flew 15 hours to come to Japan to visit a Starbucks? Yes, I would, if it is _this_ Starbucks.")

  * There's a ton of higher-end shopping in the area. Start with Kindal.

* Ningyōchō (if focusing on food)

  * [Dormy Inn](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Dormy+Inn+Premium+Tokyo+Kodenmacho/@35.6878288,139.7778226,16.15z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x6018895357be572f:0x8a62264a873af47a!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d35.6903542!4d139.7781281!16s%2Fg%2F11c1352p1r?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDExNS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) - it's a chain but the one in Kodenmacho is well located and has top notch breakfast and spa

  * The Tourist Hotel & Cafe Akihabara (no breakfast or spa but more hip)
