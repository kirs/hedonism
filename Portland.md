Things to do

* Browse books in **Powell's City of Books** (they sell used and new books)
* Watch a movie in **Cinema 21**, a vintage theater
* Check out _Portland Saturday Market_ or _Portland Farmers Market_
* Have breakfast at **Fried Egg I'm In Love** on Hawthorne (not the one on the west side). Their sandwiches was one of my highlights.
* Visit **Loyly sauna** - it's an authentic Finnish sauna with public hours for just $30 for a visit. It's really well designed.
* Skip _Voodoo Doughnut_, they're overrated

* Portland's special is food trucks grouped into food pods. My favourite is [this one](https://www.google.com/maps/place/45%C2%B030'45.8%22N+122%C2%B039'18.0%22W/@45.5127624,-122.6556205,18.83z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x2ed39841d6763855!7e2!8m2!3d45.5127223!4d-122.6549943) but you'll find lots of blocks across the city with food trucks. Explore and try things!
* [Coava Coffee Roasters](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Coava+Coffee+Roasters/@45.5137639,-122.6605095,16.54z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xc63aec4f3d1b3aad!8m2!3d45.5135494!4d-122.6606018) is a must if you're into coffee. They have a well designed space and they share the building with woodworking shop.

## Various food

* Pacific Pie Company
* Lardo
* Bollywood Theater
* Sammich PDX
* I'll repeat **Fried Egg I'm In Love** because it's really good

## Breweries

* Baerlic Brewery & Taproom
* Cascade Brewing Barrel House

### Other activities

* If you're going camping, go to [Next Adventure](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Next+Adventure/@45.5160095,-122.6647758,15.62z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x54950b0b7da97427:0x1c36b9e6f6d18591!2sPortland,+OR,+USA!3b1!8m2!3d45.515232!4d-122.6783853!3m4!1s0x0:0x72795722375e344a!8m2!3d45.5194848!4d-122.6604253) - their basement floor has great deals and I could equip for camping for $100 total.
* Drive to Columbia River George and Multnomah Falls
* Drive futher that scentic route and make it around Mt Hood and camp somewhere in the area.
